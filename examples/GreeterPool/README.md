# GreeterPool

The GreeterPool example illustrates how to send requests in parallel to multiple greeters.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Server/Server.csproj
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```
