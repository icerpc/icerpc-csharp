# Compress

This example application illustrates how to use the compress interceptor and middleware to
transparently compress and decompress requests and responses.

For build instructions check the top-level [README.md](../README.md#building).

First start the Server program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Server/Server.csproj
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```
