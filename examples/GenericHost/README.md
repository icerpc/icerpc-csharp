This example application shows how to use the .NET Generic Host to implement IceRPC server and client command line applications.

For build instructions checks the top-level [README.md](../../README.md).

First start the Server program:
```
dotnet run --project Server/Server.csproj
```
In a separate window, start the Client program:
```
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```
