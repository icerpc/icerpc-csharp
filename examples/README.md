## Building

To build each example, you can use the `dotnet build` command with the corresponding solution or project
files. The project files are configured to use IceRPC NuGet packages.

If you want to build all the examples at once, you can run the following command:

For Linux and macOS:

```shell
./build.sh --examples
```

For Windows

```shell
build -examples
```

To use the IceRPC distribution from this repository instead of the one from the published NuGet packages, you need to
build and install the NuGet packages from this repository before building the examples. You can do this by running the
following command:

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh --examples --srcdist
```

For Windows

```shell
build -examples -srcdist
```

## Examples

### [Authorization](./Authorization/)

The Authorization example illustrates how to create an authorization interceptor and middleware that can be used to
authorize requests.

### [Compress](./Compress/)

The Compress example shows how to use the deflate interceptor and middleware to compress and decompress the arguments
and return the value of an invocation.

### [Download](./Download/)

The Download example shows how to download a file using streaming from a server.

### [GenericHost](./GenericHost/)

The GenericHost example shows how to create client and server applications using Microsoft's Dependency Injection
container.

### [Greeter](./Greeter/)

The Greeter example shows how to create a minimal client and server application implementing the canonical "Hello World".

### [GreeterCore](./GreeterCore/)

The GreeterCore example shows how to create a minimal client and server application using IceRPC's core API--without
Slice definitions or generated code.

### [GreeterQuic](./GreeterQuic/)

The GreeterQuic example is the Greeter example updated to use the QUIC transport instead of the default TCP transport.

### [GreeterLog](./GreeterLog/)

The GreeterLog example is the Greeter example updated to include logging.

### [Interop](./Interop/)

Contains examples that shows how IceRPC interoperates with [ZeroC Ice][1].

### [Metrics](./Metrics/)

The Metrics example shows how to use the metric interceptor and middleware with `dotnet-counters` and `dotnet-trace` to
monitor requests dispatched by a server.

### [OpenTelemetry](./OpenTelemetry/)

The OpenTelemetry example shows how to use the telemetry interceptor and middleware and how to integrated them with
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to export traces to [Zipkin][2].

### [RequestContext](./RequestContext/)

The RequestContext example shows how to attach contextual information to the invocation and access this information from
the dispatch.

### [Retry](./Retry/)

The Retry example shows how to use the retry interceptor to retry failed invocations.

### [Secure](./Secure/)

The Secure example shows how to create client and server applications that communicate using TLS secured connections.

### [Stream](./Stream/)

The Stream example shows how to stream data from a client to a server.

### [Upload](./Upload/)

The Upload example shows how to upload a file from a client to a sever using streaming.
