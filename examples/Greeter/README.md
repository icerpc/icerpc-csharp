# Greeter

The Greeter example illustrates how to send a request and wait for the response.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Server/Server.csproj
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```

> This is a concise example with minimal code. If you are looking for a more realistic example, see the
> [GreeterLog](../GreeterLog/README.md) example.
