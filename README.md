# IceRPC

![.github/workflows/dotnet.yml](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/icerpc-csharp/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=main)

# Testing

The test suite can be run from the command line by running `dotnet test` command in the repository top-level
directory, this command builds `IceRpc.sln` solution an execute all tests from the solution.

For additional options see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test

You can also run the tests from Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac using the builtin test explorer, in this
case you need to use `IceRpc.sln` solution file.

Visual Studio Code users can install [.NET Core Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer)
plug-in to run tests from it.


# Building Example Programs

You can build each demo by using `dotnet build` command and the corresponding solution or project files, the example
programs are configured to use IceRCP NuGet packages.

If you want to build all examples at once run:

```
dotnet msbuild build/build.proj /t:BuildExamples /restore
```

If you want to use the IceRPC distribution from this repository instead of IceRPC from a published NuGet package, you need
to build and install the NuGet package from this repository before building the examples, this can be done by running the 
following command:

```
dotnet msbuild build/build.proj /t:InstallLocalPackages /restore
```
