/// decoded but not read reaches the pause writer threshold, and the writer resumes when the number of bytes decoded
/// but not read falls below the resume writer threshold. These bytes are not counted one by one but
/// buffer-by-buffer: as soon as 1 element decoded from a buffer is read, all the bytes from that buffer are
