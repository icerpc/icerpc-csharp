## Build Requirements

Building IceRpc requires Rust and .NET development environments:

- A Rust development environment
- The .NET 7.0 SDK

The build system for the `slicec-cs` compiler fetches the `slicec` library from the `slicec` private repository. If the
build fails to fetch `slicec` with a permission denied error, set the following environment variable:

```shell
export CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true
```

and then try again. This tells Cargo to use git's executable to fetch dependencies instead of it's own.

## Building

You can build IceRPC from a regular command prompt, using the following commands

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh
```

For Windows

```shell
build
```

This builds the [slicec-cs](./tools/slicec-cs) compiler, the IceRPC runtime assemblies, and the IceRPC unit tests in the
default debug configuration.

Visual Studio Code users can use `Tasks: Run Build Task...` from the command palette.

## Packaging

After building IceRPC you can create the corresponding NuGet packages by running the following command

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh pack
```

For Windows

```shell
build pack
```

You can push the packages to the `global-packages` source with the following command:

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh push
```

For Windows

```shell
build push
```

This allow using the NuGet packages from the local `global-packages` source.

## Testing

You can run the test suite from the command line using the `dotnet test` command in the repository's top-level directory. This command builds `IceRpc.sln` solution an executes all tests from the solution.

For additional options see <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test>.

To create a code coverage reports using [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator)

Install the reportgenerator dotnet tool

```shell
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

Run the tests with code coverage

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh test --coverage
```

For Windows

```shell
build test --coverage
```

## Building Example Programs

You can build each demo by using `dotnet build` command and the corresponding solution or project files, the example
programs are configured to use IceRPC NuGet packages.

If you want to build all examples at once run the following command:

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh --examples
```

For Windows

```shell
build --examples
```

If you want to use the IceRPC distribution from this repository instead of IceRPC from a published NuGet package, you
will need to build and install the NuGet package from this repository before building the examples. This can be done by
running the following command:

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh --examples --srcdist
```

For Windows

```shell
build --examples --srcdist
```

## Project Templates

The `IceRpc.ProjectTemplates` NuGet package provides project templates for `dotnet new`, install the templates using:

```shell
dotnet new install IceRpc.ProjectTemplates
```

To install the templates using a source build run the following command:

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh install-templates
```

For Windows

```shell
build install-templates
```

The `IceRpc.ProjectTemplates` package provides the following templates:

| Template Name   | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `icerpc-client` | Template for command line client applications. |
| `icerpc-server` | Template for command line server applications. |

### Usage

```shell
dotnet new <template-name>
```

> :point_up: `dotnet new -h` for help.

## Generating API Documentation

Before generating the documentation ensure that the `docfx` command is present in your PATH; version 2.63 or greater is
required.

The reference documentation for IceRPC API can be built using the following command:

For Linux and macOS

```shell
./build.sh doc
```

For Windows

```shell
build doc
```

Upon completion the documentation is placed in the `doc\_site` directory.
