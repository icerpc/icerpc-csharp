# Coloc Transport for IceRPC

IceRpc.Coloc is an implementation of [IceRPC][icerpc]'s duplex transport abstraction. You can use this transport to send
RPCs to services hosted by IceRPC servers in your local application.

The primary use case for this transport is testing. Several unit tests running in the same process can easily and cheaply
create their own private coloc connections.

This transport does not use network APIs. It is available on all platforms.
