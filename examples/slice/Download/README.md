This example application illustrates how to transmit a file from a server to a client as a stream of bytes.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
