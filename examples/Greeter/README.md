# Greeter

The Greeter example illustrates how to send a request and wait for the response.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Server/Server.csproj
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```

> This example is a minimal example with very few lines of code.  If you are looking for a more realistic example, see
> the [GreeterLog](../GreeterLog/README.md) example.
