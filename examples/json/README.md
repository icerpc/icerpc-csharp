# Json

The Json example illustrates how to use JSON to encode the payloads of IceRPC requests and
responses.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
