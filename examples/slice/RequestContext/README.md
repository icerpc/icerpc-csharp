# RequestContext

This example illustrates how to use the request context interceptor to encode request context features into request
context fields. It also shows how to use the request context middleware to decode request context fields into request
context features.

This example uses QUIC, IceRPC's default multiplexed transport. On Linux and macOS, QUIC requires extra setup
steps; see .NET's [QUIC platform dependencies][quic-platform].

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate terminal, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
