# IceRPC Slice files

This directory provides [Slice][slice] definitions shared by all IceRPC implementations.

| Subdirectory   | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Ice            | Interfaces and exceptions provided for interop with [Ice][zeroc-ice] applications.|
| IceRpc         | Enumerations that specify response status codes, request field keys, response field keys and known compression formats.|
| WellKnownTypes | Custom types supported by all IceRPC implementations.|
| **/Internal    | Enumerations and compact structs used by IceRPC implementations to implement the [ice][ice-protocol] protocol, the [icerpc][icerpc-protocol] protocol, the Slice [encoding][slice-encoding] and the [Slic][slic] multiplexing adapter. These are internal IceRPC implementation detailsâ€”applications built with IceRPC don't need to see these definitions.|

The copy of record for these Slice files is the [icerpc-slice][icerpc-slice] repository. Each IceRPC implementation is
expected to create its own read-only clone of these Slice files with `git subtree`. For example, the `slice` directory
of the [icerpc-csharp][icerpc-csharp] repository is a git subtree clone of icerpc-slice.
