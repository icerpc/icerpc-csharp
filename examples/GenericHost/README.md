This example shows how to use dependency injection and the .NET Generic Host with IceRpc client and server applications.

For build instructions checks the top-level [README.md](../../README.md).

First start the Server program:

```
dotnet run --project Server/Server.csproj
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```
