# GenericHost

This example shows how to use dependency injection and the .NET Generic Host with IceRPC client and server applications.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
