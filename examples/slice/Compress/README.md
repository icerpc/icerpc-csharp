# Compress

This example application illustrates how to use the compress interceptor and middleware to
transparently compress and decompress requests and responses.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate terminal, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
