# Greeter

A simple Greeter that uses the core IceRPC APIs - and encodes request/response payloads with JSON.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate window, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
